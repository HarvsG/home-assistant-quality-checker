## Overview

The `config-flow` rule requires integrations to be configurable via the Home Assistant UI using a config flow. This includes having a `config_flow.py`, setting `config_flow: true` in `manifest.json`, storing connection parameters in `ConfigEntry.data`, other settings in `ConfigEntry.options`, and using `strings.json` for all UI text, including `data_description` for input field context.

The `music_assistant` integration **applies** to this rule as it requires configuration (the URL of the Music Assistant server) to function.

The integration **partially follows** the rule:
*   **Follows:**
    *   `manifest.json` includes `"config_flow": true`.
    *   A `config_flow.py` file is present, implementing `MusicAssistantConfigFlow` which inherits from `homeassistant.config_entries.ConfigFlow`.
    *   It correctly implements `async_step_user` to handle manual setup, presenting a form for the server URL.
    *   It uses `self.async_show_form` to display the form and `self.async_create_entry` to create the config entry.
    *   Input validation is performed by attempting to connect to the server and get server info using `get_server_info` in `async_step_user`. Errors like `cannot_connect` and `invalid_server_version` are handled and shown to the user.
    *   The server URL, which is essential for connection, is stored in `config_entry.data[CONF_URL]` as seen in `config_flow.py` and used in `__init__.py`.
    *   The integration also supports discovery via `async_step_zeroconf`.
    *   Labels for input fields are defined in `strings.json` (and `translations/en.json`) under the `config.step.init.data.url` key, which is used for single-step user flows.

*   **Does NOT Follow (Minor):**
    *   The rule explicitly states: "use `data_description` in the `strings.json` to give context about the input field."
    *   In `homeassistant/components/music_assistant/strings.json`, the `config.step.init` section (which is used for the single-step user-initiated flow) defines the label for the `url` field but lacks the `data_description` for it.
        ```json
        // homeassistant/components/music_assistant/strings.json
        {
          "config": {
            "step": {
              "init": {
                "data": {
                  "url": "URL of the Music Assistant server"
                }
                // "data_description" for "url" is missing here
              },
              // ...
            }
          },
          // ...
        }
        ```
    This means that while the user is prompted for a URL, there is no additional descriptive text below the input field to provide more context or an example, as recommended by the rule for better user-friendliness.

## Suggestions

To fully comply with the `config-flow` rule, the integration should add `data_description` for the input fields in its configuration flow.

1.  **Modify `homeassistant/components/music_assistant/strings.json`:**
    Add a `data_description` object within the `config.step.init` section for the `url` field.

    ```diff
    // homeassistant/components/music_assistant/strings.json
    {
      "config": {
        "step": {
          "init": {
            "data": {
              "url": "URL of the Music Assistant server"
            },
    +       "data_description": {
    +         "url": "Enter the full URL of your Music Assistant server, e.g., http://mass.local:8095 or http://your_server_ip:8095."
    +       }
          },
          "manual": {
            "title": "Manually add Music Assistant server",
            "description": "Enter the URL to your already running Music Assistant server. If you do not have the Music Assistant server running, you should install it first.",
            "data": {
              "url": "URL of the Music Assistant server"
            }
    +       // Consider adding data_description here too if this step is directly used for input
    +       // "data_description": {
    +       //   "url": "Enter the full URL of your Music Assistant server, e.g., http://mass.local:8095 or http://your_server_ip:8095."
    +       // }
          },
          // ...
        }
      },
      // ...
    }
    ```

2.  **Update `homeassistant/components/music_assistant/translations/en.json` (and other translation files):**
    Mirror the structure by adding the `data_description` for `url` in the `config.step.init` section.

    ```diff
    // homeassistant/components/music_assistant/translations/en.json
    {
        "config": {
            // ...
            "step": {
                // ...
                "init": {
                    "data": {
                        "url": "URL of the Music Assistant server"
                    },
    +               "data_description": {
    +                   "url": "Enter the full URL of your Music Assistant server, e.g., http://mass.local:8095 or http://your_server_ip:8095."
    +               }
                },
                "manual": {
                    "data": {
                        "url": "URL of the Music Assistant server"
                    },
    +               // "data_description": {
    +               //     "url": "Enter the full URL of your Music Assistant server, e.g., http://mass.local:8095 or http://your_server_ip:8095."
    +               // },
                    "description": "Enter the URL to your already running Music Assistant server. If you do not have the Music Assistant server running, you should install it first.",
                    "title": "Manually add Music Assistant server"
                }
            }
        },
        // ...
    }
    ```

**Why these changes satisfy the rule:**
Adding `data_description` provides users with more context for the `url` field directly in the UI, enhancing user-friendliness and understandability, as specified by the rule: "This means we should use the right selectors at the right place, validate the input where needed, and use `data_description` in the `strings.json` to give context about the input field."
