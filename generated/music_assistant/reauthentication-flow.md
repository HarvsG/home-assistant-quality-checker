| Name   | [music_assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/music_assistant/) |
| Rule   | [reauthentication-flow](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/reauthentication-flow)                                                     |
| Status | **exempt**                                       |
| Reason | The integration configures a URL to the Music Assistant server but does not manage authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, usernames, passwords) within its Home Assistant configuration entry that would necessitate a re-authentication flow. |

## Overview

The `reauthentication-flow` rule requires integrations that use authentication to provide a UI flow for users to re-enter credentials if they become invalid (e.g., due to a password change on the service). This typically involves implementing `async_step_reauth` and `async_step_reauth_confirm` in the `config_flow.py` file.

The rule includes an exception: "If the integration doesn't require any form of authentication, this rule doesn't apply."

The `music_assistant` integration's configuration flow, as defined in `homeassistant/components/music_assistant/config_flow.py`, primarily involves discovering or manually inputting the URL of the Music Assistant server.

During the user setup step (`async_step_user`):
```python
# homeassistant/components/music_assistant/config_flow.py
# ...
    async def async_step_user(
        self, user_input: dict[str, Any] | None = None
    ) -> ConfigFlowResult:
        errors: dict[str, str] = {}
        if user_input is not None:
            try:
                self.server_info = await get_server_info(
                    self.hass, user_input[CONF_URL]  # Only CONF_URL is used here
                )
                # ...
            # ...
            else:
                return self.async_create_entry(
                    title=DEFAULT_TITLE,
                    data={
                        CONF_URL: self.server_info.base_url,  # Only CONF_URL is stored in the entry data
                    },
                )
# ...
```
The data stored in the Home Assistant config entry for this integration is solely the URL of the Music Assistant server (e.g., `{'url': 'http://mass.local:8095'}`). The integration does not ask for or store other authentication credentials like API keys, usernames, or passwords for the Music Assistant server itself.

When the integration is set up (`async_setup_entry` in `homeassistant/components/music_assistant/__init__.py`):
```python
# homeassistant/components/music_assistant/__init__.py
# ...
    mass_url = entry.data[CONF_URL]  # Retrieves the URL from config entry
    mass = MusicAssistantClient(mass_url, http_session)
# ...
```
The `MusicAssistantClient` is initialized only with this URL. If the Music Assistant server itself (at the provided URL) requires authentication (e.g., a login page or an API key for its own API), that authentication mechanism is handled by the `music-assistant-client` library or the server, not through credentials directly managed and stored by the Home Assistant config entry.

Since the Home Assistant integration for `music_assistant` does not store authentication credentials that could become invalid and require re-entry through a Home Assistant re-authentication flow (as exemplified by the rule's API token example), the `reauthentication-flow` rule is not applicable. If the URL itself becomes invalid, this would typically be a reconfiguration matter, not a re-authentication of credentials.

Therefore, the integration is **exempt** from this rule.
