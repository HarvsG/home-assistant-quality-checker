## Overview

The `diagnostics` rule requires integrations to implement a way for users to download diagnostic information, which is crucial for debugging. This information should be comprehensive but must redact sensitive data like tokens, passwords, or personal identifiers.

The `nest` integration has a `diagnostics.py` file and implements both `async_get_config_entry_diagnostics` and `async_get_device_diagnostics`. These functions gather data from the underlying `google-nest-sdm` library (via `diagnostics.get_diagnostics()` and `device.get_diagnostics()`) and also include diagnostics from the camera component.

However, the `async_get_config_entry_diagnostics` function in `homeassistant/components/nest/diagnostics.py` does **not** include the Home Assistant `config_entry.data` or `config_entry.options`. The rule's example clearly shows the inclusion of redacted `entry.data`:
```python
    return {
        "entry_data": async_redact_data(entry.data, TO_REDACT),
        "data": entry.runtime_data.data,
    }
```
The `nest` integration's `config_entry.data` stores several sensitive pieces of information, including:
*   `token`: Contains OAuth access and refresh tokens.
*   `project_id`: The Device Access Project ID.
*   `cloud_project_id`: The Google Cloud Project ID.
*   `subscriber_id` / `subscription_name`: The Pub/Sub subscription ID.
*   `topic_name`: The Pub/Sub topic name.

These are critical for the integration's operation but must be redacted if included in diagnostics. Currently, this entire section of config entry information is missing from the diagnostics output.

While the `diagnostics.py` file defines `REDACT_DEVICE_TRAITS = {InfoTrait.NAME}`, this variable is not actively used in the provided diagnostic functions to redact data from the `google-nest-sdm` library. The primary responsibility for redacting sensitive data from `config_entry.data` lies within the Home Assistant integration's diagnostic code itself.

Therefore, the integration does not fully follow the rule because it omits the (redacted) `config_entry.data` and `config_entry.options` from the diagnostics report.

## Suggestions

To make the `nest` integration compliant with the `diagnostics` rule:

1.  **Import `async_redact_data`:**
    Ensure `async_redact_data` is imported from `homeassistant.helpers.redact`.
    ```python
    from homeassistant.helpers.redact import async_redact_data
    ```

2.  **Define Keys for Redaction:**
    In `homeassistant/components/nest/diagnostics.py`, define a list or set of keys from `config_entry.data` and `config_entry.options` that should be redacted.
    ```python
    from .const import (
        CONF_PROJECT_ID,
        CONF_SUBSCRIBER_ID, # or CONF_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME, check which is in entry.data
        CONF_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID,
        CONF_TOPIC_NAME,
        # Add CONF_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME if it's distinct and used
    )

    CONFIG_ENTRY_TO_REDACT = {
        "token",  # This will redact the entire token dictionary, which is good.
        CONF_PROJECT_ID,
        CONF_SUBSCRIBER_ID, # or the key actually used in config_entry.data
        CONF_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID,
        CONF_TOPIC_NAME,
        # Consider other potentially sensitive identifiers if any
    }
    ```

3.  **Include and Redact `config_entry.data` and `config_entry.options`:**
    Modify `async_get_config_entry_diagnostics` to include redacted versions of `config_entry.data` and `config_entry.options`.

    ```python
    # In homeassistant/components/nest/diagnostics.py

    async def async_get_config_entry_diagnostics(
        hass: HomeAssistant, config_entry: NestConfigEntry
    ) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Return diagnostics for a config entry."""
        entry_diagnostics = {
            "title": config_entry.title,
            "version": config_entry.version,
            "domain": config_entry.domain,
            "source": config_entry.source,
            "unique_id": config_entry.unique_id, # May also need redaction if sensitive
            "data": async_redact_data(config_entry.data, CONFIG_ENTRY_TO_REDACT),
            "options": async_redact_data(config_entry.options, CONFIG_ENTRY_TO_REDACT),
        }

        runtime_data_diagnostics = {}
        if (
            hasattr(config_entry, "runtime_data")
            and config_entry.runtime_data
            and (device_manager := config_entry.runtime_data.device_manager)
            and (nest_devices := device_manager.devices)
        ):
            runtime_data_diagnostics = {
                "library_diagnostics": diagnostics.get_diagnostics(),  # From google_nest_sdm
                "devices": [
                    # It's assumed nest_device.get_diagnostics() from the library is safe
                    # or redacts its own sensitive data. If not, further redaction here
                    # might be needed, though harder without knowing its structure.
                    nest_device.get_diagnostics() for nest_device in nest_devices.values()
                ],
            }

        data: dict[str, Any] = {
            "config_entry": entry_diagnostics,
            "runtime_data": runtime_data_diagnostics,
        }

        camera_data = await camera_diagnostics.async_get_config_entry_diagnostics(
            hass, config_entry
        )
        if camera_data:
            data["camera_diagnostics"] = camera_data
        return data
    ```

By implementing these changes, the diagnostics will include valuable configuration information (properly redacted) alongside the runtime and device data, making it more comprehensive for debugging while adhering to privacy requirements. This aligns with the spirit and example provided by the `diagnostics` rule.
