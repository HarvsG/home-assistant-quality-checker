## Overview

The `strict-typing` rule applies to the `nest` integration. This rule mandates the use of type hints throughout the integration's Python code to enable static type checking with MyPy, thereby catching potential bugs early. For integrations utilizing `config_entry.runtime_data`, a custom typed `ConfigEntry` (e.g., `MyIntegrationConfigEntry`) is required.

The `nest` integration has made significant strides towards adhering to this rule and is very close to full compliance.

**Positive Aspects:**
*   **Custom Typed ConfigEntry:** The integration correctly defines and uses a custom typed `ConfigEntry`. In `homeassistant/components/nest/types.py`, `NestData` is a dataclass holding runtime data, and `NestConfigEntry = ConfigEntry[NestData]` provides the required typed config entry. This `NestConfigEntry` is consistently used in function signatures across various files (e.g., `__init__.py`, `camera.py`, `climate.py`).
*   **`from __future__ import annotations`:** This directive is present in most Python files (e.g., `__init__.py`, `api.py`, `config_flow.py`, `camera.py`, `climate.py`, `sensor.py`, `event.py`, `diagnostics.py`, `device_info.py`, `media_source.py`, `device_trigger.py`), enabling modern type hint usage.
*   **Function Signatures:** The majority of function and method signatures have type hints for both parameters and return values. This is evident across almost all modules.
*   **Dependencies:** The primary dependency `google-nest-sdm` appears to be typed, which facilitates better typing within the integration itself.

**Areas for Minor Improvement:**
While the typing is generally excellent, a few minor areas prevent it from being "fully" compliant:
1.  **Missing `from __future__ import annotations`:**
    *   `homeassistant/components/nest/application_credentials.py`
    *   `homeassistant/components/nest/events.py` (though this file is mostly constants)
2.  **Unspecific `dict` or variable types:** In a few places, `dict` is used without specifying its key/value types, or a variable's type could be more explicit.
    *   `homeassistant/components/nest/config_flow.py`: Some `user_input` parameters are typed as `dict | None` instead of `dict[str, Any] | None`. For example, in `async_step_cloud_project` and `async_step_device_project`. While `voluptuous` handles schema validation, more explicit typing is preferred.
    *   `homeassistant/components/nest/device_info.py`: In `async_nest_devices_by_device_id`, `devices = {}` could be explicitly typed as `devices: dict[str, Device] = {}`.
    *   `homeassistant/components/nest/media_source.py`:
        *   In `NestEventMediaStore.async_load`, the return type `dict | None` could be `dict[str, Any] | None`.
        *   In `NestEventMediaStore.async_save`, the parameter `data: dict` could be `data: dict[str, Any]`.

These are minor points, and the integration is largely very well-typed. Addressing these would bring it to full compliance and make it ready for inclusion in the `.strict-typing` file for MyPy's strict mode.

## Suggestions

To achieve full compliance with the `strict-typing` rule:

1.  **Add `from __future__ import annotations`:**
    Ensure this line is at the top of all Python files that use type hints. Specifically, add it to:
    *   `homeassistant/components/nest/application_credentials.py`
    *   `homeassistant/components/nest/events.py`

2.  **Use Specific Generic Types for `dict`:**
    Replace unspecific `dict` annotations with `dict[KeyType, ValueType]` where appropriate.
    *   In `homeassistant/components/nest/config_flow.py`:
        *   Change `user_input: dict | None` to `user_input: dict[str, Any] | None` in methods like `async_step_cloud_project`, `async_step_device_project`, and `async_step_pubsub_topic_confirm`.
    *   In `homeassistant/components/nest/media_source.py`:
        *   Change `NestEventMediaStore.async_load(self) -> dict | None:` to `async_load(self) -> dict[str, Any] | None:`.
        *   Change `NestEventMediaStore.async_save(self, data: dict) -> None:` to `async_save(self, data: dict[str, Any]) -> None:`.

3.  **Explicitly Type Variables:**
    For improved clarity and stricter checking, explicitly type variables where the inferred type might be too broad or ambiguous.
    *   In `homeassistant/components/nest/device_info.py`:
        *   Change `devices = {}` to `devices: dict[str, Device] = {}` in `async_nest_devices_by_device_id`.

4.  **Consider for `.strict-typing`:**
    Once the above minor adjustments are made, the integration should be robust enough to be added to the `.strict-typing` file in the Home Assistant core repository. This will enable MyPy's strict mode for the `nest` component, ensuring ongoing high standards of type safety.

These changes are relatively minor and will solidify the already strong typing foundation of the `nest` integration, ensuring it fully meets the `strict-typing` quality scale rule.
