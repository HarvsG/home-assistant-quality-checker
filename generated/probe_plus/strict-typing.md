## Overview

The `strict-typing` rule applies to the `probe_plus` integration as it aims to improve code quality and reduce bugs through static type checking, which is beneficial for all integrations.

The `probe_plus` integration demonstrates a strong foundation in type hinting:
*   **Extensive Type Hinting:** Most function signatures, return types, class attributes, and variables are type-hinted across its files.
    *   Example: `async_setup_entry` in `__init__.py` (`hass: HomeAssistant, entry: ProbePlusConfigEntry`) -> `bool`.
    *   Example: `self.device: ProbePlusDevice` in `coordinator.py`.
    *   Example: `value_fn: Callable[[ProbePlusDevice], int | float | None]` in `sensor.py`.
*   **Custom Typed ConfigEntry for `runtime-data`:** The integration correctly uses `entry.runtime_data` (as seen in `__init__.py: entry.runtime_data = coordinator`). As per the rule's warning, it defines and uses a custom typed `ConfigEntry`: `type ProbePlusConfigEntry = ConfigEntry[ProbePlusDataUpdateCoordinator]` (defined in `coordinator.py`). This custom type is consistently used for `ConfigEntry` objects throughout the integration (e.g., in `__init__.py`, `coordinator.py`, `sensor.py`).
*   **`from __future__ import annotations`:** This is used in most Python files (`__init__.py`, `coordinator.py`, `entity.py`, `config_flow.py`), which is good practice.

However, to fully comply with the `strict-typing` rule, the following aspects need to be addressed:

1.  **Enable Strict Checks in Home Assistant Core:** The rule states, "In the Home Assistant codebase, you can add your integration to the [`.strict-typing`](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/.strict-typing) file, which will enable strict type checks for your integration." Without being listed in this file, the integration's code is not subjected to the strictest `mypy` checking mode enforced by Home Assistant's CI. This is a crucial step for ensuring the highest level of type safety as defined by the project.
2.  **Missing `from __future__ import annotations` in `sensor.py`:** The file `homeassistant/components/probe_plus/sensor.py` does not include `from __future__ import annotations` at the beginning. While the current type hints in this file might work correctly in modern Python versions, adding this import ensures consistency with other files in the integration and the prevailing Home Assistant coding standards, and it robustly handles any potential forward reference issues.
3.  **External Library Typing (PEP-561):** The rule recommends that the external library used by the integration (`pyprobeplus`) be PEP-561 compliant (i.e., include a `py.typed` file). While the integration's code does use type hints for objects from this library (e.g., `ProbePlusDevice`), full type checking benefits are realized when the library itself signals that it's fully typed. This is more of a recommendation for the library's maintainer but is relevant to the overall strict typing goal.

Due to point 1 (not being verifiable in `.strict-typing` and it being a requirement for HA's strict checks) and point 2 (minor inconsistency), the integration is currently marked as "todo".

## Suggestions

To make the `probe_plus` integration compliant with the `strict-typing` rule:

1.  **Add `probe_plus` to the `.strict-typing` file:**
    *   In the `home-assistant/core` repository, edit the `.strict-typing` file located at the root.
    *   Add the following line to this file (sorted alphabetically):
        ```
        homeassistant/components/probe_plus/
        ```
    *   **Why:** This change opts the `probe_plus` integration into the strictest `mypy` checks performed by Home Assistant's CI. It ensures that all type hints are rigorously validated according to the project's highest standards, which is a core aspect of this rule.

2.  **Add `from __future__ import annotations` to `sensor.py`:**
    *   At the very beginning of the file `homeassistant/components/probe_plus/sensor.py`, add the following import:
        ```python
        from __future__ import annotations
        ```
    *   **Why:** This ensures that all type hints within the file are evaluated as strings, preventing potential issues with forward references, especially in older Python versions or complex type situations. It also aligns `sensor.py` with the other Python files in the integration and general Home Assistant core coding practices.

3.  **(Recommended) Verify and Encourage PEP-561 Compliance for `pyprobeplus`:**
    *   Check if the `pyprobeplus` library (version `1.0.0` as per `manifest.json`) is PEP-561 compliant (i.e., includes a `py.typed` marker file in its distributed package).
    *   If it is not, consider reaching out to the maintainer of `pyprobeplus` (e.g., by opening an issue on its repository) to encourage them to add PEP-561 support.
    *   **Why:** A PEP-561 compliant library allows `mypy` and other type checkers to reliably use the type hints provided by the library. This enhances the end-to-end type safety of the `probe_plus` integration, as `mypy` can then better understand and validate interactions with `pyprobeplus` objects like `ProbePlusDevice`. While this is an external dependency, it's part of achieving a robustly typed ecosystem.
