## Overview

The `strict-typing` rule applies to the `jewish_calendar` integration. This rule mandates the use of type hints throughout the codebase to help catch bugs early using static type checkers like `mypy`. It also requires specific handling for `config_entry.runtime_data`.

The `jewish_calendar` integration largely adheres to strict typing principles but falls short in a few areas:

1.  **Custom `ConfigEntry` with `runtime_data`:**
    The rule states: "If the integration implements `runtime-data`, the use of a custom typed `MyIntegrationConfigEntry` is required and must be used throughout."
    *   The integration correctly defines a custom `ConfigEntry` type in `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/entity.py`:
        ```python
        type JewishCalendarConfigEntry = ConfigEntry[JewishCalendarData]
        ```
    *   It also assigns data to `config_entry.runtime_data` in `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/__init__.py`:
        ```python
        config_entry.runtime_data = JewishCalendarData(...)
        ```
    *   This `JewishCalendarConfigEntry` type is consistently used in function signatures across various files (e.g., `async_setup_entry` in `__init__.py`, entity constructors, `config_flow.py` methods, `diagnostics.py`). This aspect of the rule is **followed**.

2.  **Comprehensive Type Hinting:**
    *   Most function signatures for parameters and return values are type-hinted.
    *   Dataclasses (`JewishCalendarData`, `JewishCalendarDataResults`, various `SensorEntityDescription` extensions) are used effectively with type hints.
    *   This demonstrates a good effort towards type safety.

3.  **`from __future__ import annotations`:**
    *   This import is crucial for enabling postponed evaluation of annotations (PEP 563), allowing for cleaner type hints, especially with forward references.
    *   It is **present** in:
        *   `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/__init__.py`
        *   `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/config_flow.py`
        *   `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/sensor.py`
        *   `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/binary_sensor.py`
    *   It is **missing** in:
        *   `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/entity.py`
        *   `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/service.py`
        *   `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/diagnostics.py`

The absence of `from __future__ import annotations` in the noted files prevents the integration from being fully compliant with the "strict-typing" rule, as it can affect how `mypy` interprets type hints and limits the use of modern typing features. While the core requirement for `runtime_data` and custom `ConfigEntry` is met, full adherence to strict typing involves ensuring all modules are prepared for robust type checking.

Therefore, the integration is marked as "todo".

## Suggestions

To make the `jewish_calendar` integration fully compliant with the `strict-typing` rule:

1.  **Add `from __future__ import annotations`:**
    Ensure this import statement is present at the very beginning (after any module-level docstrings, before other imports) of the following files:
    *   `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/entity.py`
    *   `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/service.py`
    *   `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/diagnostics.py`

    Example for `entity.py`:
    ```python
    """Entity representing a Jewish Calendar sensor."""

    from __future__ import annotations  # Add this line

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    # ... rest of the imports
    ```

    **Why:** This statement enables PEP 563 (Postponed Evaluation of Annotations). It ensures that all type hints are stored as strings at runtime, which resolves issues with forward references (using a type name before it's defined) without needing to quote them, and generally makes type hinting more flexible and future-proof. This is a standard practice for modern Python code aiming for strict typing.

By implementing this change, the integration will fully leverage Python's typing capabilities, making it more robust and easier for `mypy` to perform comprehensive static analysis, thus satisfying the `strict-typing` rule.
