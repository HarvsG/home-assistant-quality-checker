## Overview

The `devices` rule applies to the `jewish_calendar` integration because it creates multiple sensor and binary_sensor entities that logically belong to a single "Jewish Calendar" service. Grouping these entities under a device improves the user experience by presenting a unified representation of the service.

The integration partially follows this rule. In `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/entity.py`, the `JewishCalendarEntity` class initializes a `DeviceInfo` object:
```python
# homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/entity.py
# ...
class JewishCalendarEntity(Entity):
    # ...
    def __init__(
        self,
        config_entry: JewishCalendarConfigEntry,
        description: EntityDescription,
    ) -> None:
        # ...
        self._attr_device_info = DeviceInfo(
            entry_type=DeviceEntryType.SERVICE,
            identifiers={(DOMAIN, config_entry.entry_id)},
        )
        # ...
```
This correctly establishes a device for the integration's entities and marks it as a `DeviceEntryType.SERVICE`.

However, the integration does not fully follow the rule because the provided `DeviceInfo` is minimal. The rule states, "In order for the user to have the best experience, the information about the device should be as complete as possible." The current `DeviceInfo` only includes `entry_type` and `identifiers`. It is missing other common and useful fields such as `name`, `manufacturer`, `model`, and `sw_version`, which would provide a richer and more informative device page in Home Assistant, as exemplified by the rule's documentation.

## Suggestions

To make the `jewish_calendar` integration fully compliant with the `devices` rule, enhance the `DeviceInfo` object in `homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/entity.py` to include more details.

1.  **Import necessary modules and constants:**
    Ensure `DEFAULT_NAME` from `const.py` and `version` from `importlib.metadata` are imported in `entity.py`.

    ```python
    # homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/entity.py
    from importlib.metadata import version, PackageNotFoundError
    # ...
    from .const import DOMAIN, DEFAULT_NAME
    ```

2.  **Update the `DeviceInfo` in `JewishCalendarEntity.__init__`:**
    Populate fields like `name`, `manufacturer`, `model`, and `sw_version`.

    ```python
    # homeassistant/components/jewish_calendar/entity.py
    # ...
    class JewishCalendarEntity(Entity):
        # ...
        def __init__(
            self,
            config_entry: JewishCalendarConfigEntry,
            description: EntityDescription,
        ) -> None:
            """Initialize a Jewish Calendar entity."""
            self.entity_description = description
            self._attr_unique_id = f"{config_entry.entry_id}-{description.key}"

            try:
                hdate_sw_version = version("hdate")
            except PackageNotFoundError:
                hdate_sw_version = None  # Or a suitable placeholder

            self._attr_device_info = DeviceInfo(
                entry_type=DeviceEntryType.SERVICE,
                identifiers={(DOMAIN, config_entry.entry_id)},
                name=config_entry.title or DEFAULT_NAME, # Use config entry title or default name
                manufacturer="Home Assistant Community",  # Or the actual maintainer/project
                model="Jewish Calendar Service",
                sw_version=hdate_sw_version, # Version of the hdate library
                # Optionally, add a configuration_url if relevant
                # configuration_url=f"/config/integrations/integration/{DOMAIN}",
            )
            self.data = config_entry.runtime_data
            set_language(self.data.language)
            # ...
    ```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **`name`**: Set to `config_entry.title` (which is typically "Jewish Calendar" for this single-entry integration) or `DEFAULT_NAME` ("Jewish Calendar") from `const.py`. This provides a user-friendly name for the device.
*   **`manufacturer`**: Can be set to "Home Assistant Community" or a more specific entity if appropriate (e.g., the codeowner or the "hdate library" project). The example uses "My Company".
*   **`model`**: A descriptive model name like "Jewish Calendar Service" helps identify the nature of the device.
*   **`sw_version`**: Setting this to the version of the `hdate` library (obtained via `importlib.metadata.version("hdate")`) provides useful diagnostic information about the core dependency. The `requirements` in `manifest.json` specify `hdate[astral]==1.1.0`.

These additions will make the device information more complete, aligning with the rule's goal of providing a rich device info page for a better user experience.
