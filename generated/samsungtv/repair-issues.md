## Overview

The `repair-issues` rule requires integrations to use repair issues or repair flows for problems that require user intervention and are actionable. It emphasizes that these mechanisms should not be used merely to inform the user about unfixable issues.

This rule applies to the `samsungtv` integration as it deals with external devices that can encounter connection or authentication problems requiring user interaction.

The `samsungtv` integration utilizes Home Assistant's repair flow mechanism specifically for authentication failures.

Looking at `homeassistant/components/samsungtv/__init__.py`:
- Line 57-61: `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` is raised if `CONF_TOKEN` or `CONF_SESSION_ID` are missing for encrypted mode, which automatically triggers a reauthentication flow in Home Assistant.
- Line 63-67: A callback `_access_denied` is registered with the `SamsungTVBridge`. This callback calls `entry.async_start_reauth(hass)` when triggered, initiating a reauthentication flow.

Examining `homeassistant/components/samsungtv/bridge.py`:
- The `SamsungTVBridge` base class includes `register_reauth_callback` and calls `_notify_reauth_callback` when authentication fails (e.g., `AccessDenied` in `SamsungTVLegacyBridge._get_remote` or `UnauthorizedError` in `SamsungTVWSBridge._async_get_remote_under_lock`). This confirms that authentication failures during operation correctly trigger the registered callback which leads to the reauth flow.

The reauthentication flow is handled in `homeassistant/components/samsungtv/config_flow.py`:
- Lines 225-227: `async_step_reauth` leads to `async_step_reauth_confirm`.
- Lines 230-267: `async_step_reauth_confirm` handles the reauth attempt for non-encrypted methods. If `RESULT_SUCCESS` is returned by `bridge.async_try_connect()`, the entry is updated and reloaded. If `RESULT_AUTH_MISSING` or `RESULT_CANNOT_CONNECT` occur, an error is shown, prompting the user (this part seems slightly less clear on triggering a specific prompt vs just showing a form error, but the flow step handles the user interaction).
- Lines 281-304: `async_step_reauth_confirm_encrypted` handles reauth for encrypted methods, specifically prompting the user for a PIN (`CONF_PIN`) to obtain a new token and session ID.

These authentication issues (access denied, missing credentials, invalid PIN during reauth) are problems that require user intervention (e.g., re-pairing the TV, re-entering a PIN). The integration correctly handles these by initiating a reauthentication *flow*, which guides the user through the process to fix the issue. It does not appear to use repair *issues* (the non-fixable kind) for unactionable problems.

Therefore, the integration correctly uses repair *flows* for applicable, actionable issues requiring user intervention, fulfilling the requirements of the `repair-issues` rule.

## Suggestions

No suggestions needed. The integration correctly implements repair flows for actionable issues.
