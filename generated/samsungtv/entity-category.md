## Overview

The `entity-category` rule requires that entities representing configuration or diagnostic aspects of a device are assigned an appropriate `EntityCategory` (like `CONFIG` or `DIAGNOSTIC`) to distinguish them from primary control entities.

This rule applies to the `samsungtv` integration as it creates entities. However, the entities currently exposed by the `samsungtv` integration are `media_player` and `remote` entities, as defined in `homeassistant/components/samsungtv/__init__.py`.

These entity types represent the primary way a user interacts with a television device (watching media, controlling playback, using the remote). The default entity category (which is no category) is the appropriate classification for these primary control entities.

Reviewing the code in `homeassistant/components/samsungtv/entity.py` (the base entity), `homeassistant/components/samsungtv/media_player.py`, and `homeassistant/components/samsungtv/remote.py`, no `_attr_entity_category` is set on the entity classes. This is correct behavior because the entities are primary control entities, not configuration or diagnostic ones.

Therefore, the integration correctly follows the rule by not assigning an entity category where the default is appropriate for the primary control entities it exposes.
