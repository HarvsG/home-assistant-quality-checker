| Name   | [rflink](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rflink/) |
| Rule   | [unique-config-entry](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/unique-config-entry)                                                     |
| Status | **exempt**                                       |
| Reason | The integration is configured via YAML and does not have a config flow, which is the context for this rule. |

## Overview

The `unique-config-entry` rule aims to prevent users from accidentally setting up the same device or service multiple times, especially when using the UI-based configuration (config flow). It requires integrations with a config flow to implement checks to ensure that each configuration entry is unique, either by assigning a `unique_id` to the config entry or by verifying the uniqueness of specific data within the entry.

The `rflink` integration is configured exclusively through `configuration.yaml`. This is evident from:
1.  The `manifest.json` file, which does not include `"config_flow": true`.
    ```json
    // homeassistant/components/rflink/manifest.json
    {
      "domain": "rflink",
      "name": "RFLink",
      // ...
      "quality_scale": "legacy" 
      // No "config_flow": true
    }
    ```
2.  The presence of a `CONFIG_SCHEMA` in `homeassistant/components/rflink/__init__.py`, which defines the structure for YAML configuration:
    ```python
    // homeassistant/components/rflink/__init__.py
    CONFIG_SCHEMA = vol.Schema(
        {
            DOMAIN: vol.Schema(
                {
                    vol.Required(CONF_PORT): vol.Any(cv.port, cv.string),
                    vol.Optional(CONF_HOST): cv.string,
                    // ... other options
                }
            )
        },
        extra=vol.ALLOW_EXTRA,
    )
    ```
3.  The absence of a `config_flow.py` file in the integration's codebase.

Since `rflink` does not utilize a config flow for its setup, it does not create "config entries" in the way UI-configurable integrations do. Home Assistant's core YAML loading mechanism typically ensures that only one configuration block for the `rflink` domain is processed. The methods described by the rule for ensuring uniqueness (e.g., `self.async_set_unique_id()` or `self._async_abort_entries_match()`) are part of the `ConfigFlow` handler class and are thus not applicable to this YAML-only integration.

Therefore, the `unique-config-entry` rule, which is specifically targeted at UI-based setup and config entries generated by config flows, does not apply to the `rflink` integration.
